# Space-Race

A simple application game in which the player controls a rocket by holding his finger continuously on the screen. 
The score increases as the appearing objects reach the left edge of the screen and disappear with beautiful blue explosions. 
If the rocket meets an obstacle object, an explosion occurs and the game ends. 
After every 20 items, the speed of objects appearing on the screen increases. 
If the player passes all 10 waves, the game is over.

The game was created using SpriteKit, Timer, per-pixel collision detection, particle system, linear and angular damping.
